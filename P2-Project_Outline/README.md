# Project Outline
For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Recipe website/Database

Everyone who cooks hates trying to find recipes that are embedded inside 10-page blog posts. My program will allow users to create / edit their recipes and store them online for later use. Users can search for their desired recipe using either the name of the recipe or the desired tags (“vegetarian”, “dinner”) and then use the print function for fast and easy use. Recipes can be updated by users at any time to add notes (e.g., can use honey as a substitute for sugar), adjust the recipe itself (e.g., change ½ tsp of salt to 2 tsp of salt), and or images of the meal they just created. This program eliminates the frustration and time wasting that come with hunting for recipes online and allows busy cooks to get back to what really matters, cooking.
### Features
o	CREATE: As a user, I want to create a text-based recipe so that I can store it.

o	EDIT/DELETE: As a user, I want to edit/delete a text-based recipe so that I can update my database as needed.

o	SEARCH: As a user, I want search for a recipe by text or tags to find my desired recipe.

o	TAGS: As a user, I want to tag my recipes to maximize categorization and improve search function.

o	USER LOGIN: As a user, I can create an account and log in to the application.

o	PRINT: As a user, I want to be able to print my recipe for ease of use.

### Technologies
Node.js

MongoDB

Express

React
### What I'll Have to Learn
I'll need to learn how to use React,Express, and MongoDB. Honestly I'm not sold entirely on my backend setup. I might build a Java stck on the server side with Spring Boot and a front-end with React and JavaScript.

For this assignment, you will submit a high-level outline of your project. This can, and likely will, change over time. In particular, your mentor will provide direction and feedback to help sharpen your ideas. So don't worry if you feel unsure about some aspects of the outline or if you have to change some things later.

## Submission Instructions

### Overview
Recipe website/Database

Everyone who cooks hates trying to find recipes that are embedded inside 10-page blog posts. My program will allow users to create / edit their recipes and store them online for later use. Users can search for their desired recipe using either the name of the recipe or the desired tags (“vegetarian”, “dinner”) and then use the print function for fast and easy use. Recipes can be updated by users at any time to add notes (e.g., can use honey as a substitute for sugar), adjust the recipe itself (e.g., change ½ tsp of salt to 2 tsp of salt), and or images of the meal they just created. This program eliminates the frustration and time wasting that come with hunting for recipes online and allows busy cooks to get back to what really matters, cooking.
### Features
